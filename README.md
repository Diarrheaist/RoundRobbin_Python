# RoundRobbin_Python
A CPU scheduling program based on Round Robin algorithm using python
The goal of the project is implementation of  the Round Robin algorithm with different time quantum in order to demonstrate how much CPU resources can be used and how process will be executed according to different time quantum.

Basic Requirment 

The program is made in Python 2.7 .14, in order to run make sure that Python is installed. The program can be ran through either an IDE or command line. Make sure you have proper Python version installed otherwise there will be errors.

How to give input ?

The input is a csv file that has a format which includes process id , arrival time and burst time

How to Execute Cpu Scheduling Algorithm ?


Open terminal, run ``` cd RoundRobin ``` and run the command below. Make sure that you add the path to the csv file and the time quantum you would like to use

``` 
time quantum = 5 and process.csv is the path
C:\Users\Apurva\Desktop\rr>python main.py process.csv 5                               
```

What will I get as Output ?
In Output you will get detail turnaround , waiting and response time
You will also get cpu utlization and throughtput 

Tips :
Keep everything in one folder
Use command prompt to run code
Enjoy the day!
